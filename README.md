# 👋 Multi-Chain Blockchain Developer

  > From building infrastructure for **Avatar** and **Deadpool** at 20th Century Fox to developing **zkSNARK privacy
  solutions** on Ethereum, I've spent my career architecting systems that scale. Now focused on **multi-chain
  blockchain development** - building the infrastructure that powers DeFi across ecosystems.

  ## 🚀 What I Build

  **🔗 Multi-Chain DeFi Infrastructure**
  - Cross-chain bridges and liquidity protocols
  - RPC optimization and API development
  - DEX interfaces and yield farming tools

  **🔒 Privacy-Preserving Solutions**
  - zkSNARK exploration for private transactions
  - Learning zero-knowledge proof circuits with Circom
  - Cryptographic protocols for anonymous voting

  **⚡ Production Applications**
  - Full-stack dApps with real user adoption
  - Enterprise-grade systems with reliability focus
  - Real-time data processing and indexing

  ## 🛠 Technical Expertise

  ### **Blockchain Ecosystems**
  - **Ethereum**: Web3.js integration, ERC standards, Layer 2 solutions
  - **Solana**: Web3.js, program interaction, high-throughput dApps
  - **Cosmos**: SDK integration, IBC basics, CosmWasm exploration

  ### **Languages & Frameworks**
  TypeScript • JavaScript • Python • Golang • Rust (learning)
  Solidity (intermediate) • Web3.js • Ethers.js • Node.js • React
  PostgreSQL • Docker • Git

  ### **DeFi & Infrastructure**
  - DEX development and AMM interfaces
  - Bridge implementations and cross-chain tools
  - Wallet integrations and user experience
  - Node operations and RPC endpoints
